## Remote Layout for MiX16 ShowCue and Open Stage Control
This is a template for the MiX16 App : [ShowCuePro](https://mix16showcue.com/) for OpenStageControl...

OpenStageControl can be downloaded on their [Website](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/)...it's Open-Source and free software  

---
OSC-Control must be activated in the Show-Cue parameters-setup !   
The IP Addresses and the OSC INPUT and OUTPUT Ports must be set correctly in both : OpenstageControl and MiX16 Show Cue !  If both are on the same computer the IP-Address should be : 127.0.0.1 ...   
Please use and load also the JS file "sc_module.js" as it adds some interesting features (not available if it is not loaded).    
Important : After changing a current MiX-ShowControl-Project, you must stop and restart the OpenStageControl Server ! (Otherwise the "Sync-Function" will not work properly !)  
For using the layout with another device (tablette, iPad etc), the default port for the TCP client is 8080 (but this can be changed in the OpenStageControl Setup, if you want).   

Actual version for this O-S-C layout is v2.3 and actual version for MiX ShowCue is v4.6    
If you update the layout from an older version, please download and replace also the "sc_module.js" file, as new functions may have been added !

I sometimes update some of these Layouts, so  it may be worth to [come back here](https://github.com/ziginfo/OpenStageControl-Layouts/edit/main/mix16ShowCue) from time to time, to see if there are any updates (usually notified in the Readme-Files).     
Please contact me if you have any suggestions or requests and any help is always welcome !

Have Fun
