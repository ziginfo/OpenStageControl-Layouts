## Remote Layout for MiX16 ShowCue and Open Stage Control
This is a template for the MiX16 App : [ShowCuePro](https://mix16showcue.com/) for OpenStageControl...

---
OpenStageControl can be downloaded on their [Website](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/)...it's Open-Source and free software  

---
OSC-Control must be activated in the Show-Cue parameters-setup !    
The OSC INPUT and OUTPUT Ports must be set correctly in both : OpenstageControl and MiX16 Show Cue !  If both are on the same computer the IP-Address should be : 127.0.0.1 ...   
Please use and load also the JS file "sc_module.js" as it adds some interesting features (not available if it is not loaded).     

Please contact me if you have any suggestions or requests and any help is always welcome !   

Have Fun
